# Comparison-of-3-classification-models-in-sentiment-analysis-
> This repo is intended for thesis.
## In this repository, I compare 3 classification models including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor.  The data used for this comparison has gone through a text preprocessing process.  The data is divided into training data and test data using stratified K-Fold Cross Validation because the classes or labels in this data are not balanced.
